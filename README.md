# Introduction 
Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) Scores 
The Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) is a quantitative tool developed by the Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC), 
Government of India, to assess the environmental impact of industrial clusters. The CEPI score ranges from 0 
to 100, where: 
• Scores above 70 indicate critically polluted areas requiring urgent intervention. 
• Scores between 60-70 signify severely polluted zones needing corrective measures. 
• Scores below 60 denote less polluted regions but still under observation. 
The index considers multiple pollution parameters, including: 
• Air and water pollution levels 
• Soil contamination 
• Impact on human health 
• Ecosystem degradation 

# Importance of Monitoring Industrial Pollution 
Industrial clusters contribute significantly to environmental degradation, affecting: 
1. Public Health – High pollution levels lead to respiratory diseases, cancer, and other ailments. 
2. Biodiversity Loss – Toxic discharges harm flora and fauna. 
3. Economic Impact – Pollution-related regulations can restrict industrial growth, while cleanup costs 
burden governments. 
4. Climate Change – Industrial emissions contribute to global warming. 
Monitoring CEPI scores helps policymakers: 
• Identify pollution hotspots 
• Enforce stricter regulations 
• Implement remediation strategies 
• Track progress in pollution control 
   
# Objectives of the Analysis 
This project aims to analyze CEPI scores from 2009, 2011, and 2013 to: 
## Compare Pollution Levels Across Years (2009, 2011, 2013) 
• Determine if pollution has increased, decreased, or stabilized over time. 
• Identify trends in industrial pollution. 
## Identify Most and Least Polluted Clusters 
• Rank industrial clusters based on CEPI scores. 
• Highlight top 5 most polluted and bottom 5 least polluted areas each year. 
## Analyze Impact of Moratorium Status 
• Compare CEPI scores between regions: 
o Where moratoriums were lifted (pollution control measures implemented). 
o Where moratoriums are still in force (ongoing pollution issues). 
• Assess whether regulatory actions (moratoriums) improved pollution levels. 
## Compare Pollution Levels Across States 
• Identify states with the highest and lowest pollution. 
• Examine geographical patterns (e.g., landlocked vs. coastal states). 
## Examine Score Distributions Over Time 
• Analyze how CEPI score distributions changed between 2009 and 2013. 
• Determine if pollution control policies had a uniform or varied impact across clusters. 

# Expected Outcomes 
This analysis will provide insights into: 
• Effectiveness of pollution control measures (e.g., moratoriums). 
• Regions needing urgent intervention. 
• Long-term trends in industrial pollution.
